= Sample application with Micrometer metrics

This sample project exposes a number of endpoints you could exercises to generate some
traffic:

* Get all speakers from the database: http://localhost:8080/speakers
* Get a speaker by ID from the database: http://localhost:8080/speakers/1 (use a large number to trigger a `404`)
* Get some random info retrieved from a remote service: http://localhost:8080/initializr-info

This project configures the `LoggingMeterRegistry` that emits the metrics that are
exported to the backend.
